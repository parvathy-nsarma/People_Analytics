HR Analytics: Job change of Data Scientists


## The objective of the project is to predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company.


The focus of this project is

* Visualization

* Imbalance of data


We use python profiling, matplotlib, seaborn to help us visualize data and understand patterns.


The challenge with data is that the data set is imbalanced. To deal with this, Random sampling is performed. SMOTE and Borderline SMOTE is performed and then applying the data for above mentioned classification algorithms to see how this would enhance the performance of the models.
